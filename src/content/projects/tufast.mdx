# TUfast

My work on a browser extension that is used by multiple thousand students.

## What is TUfast?
TUfast is a browser extension made by some students of the TU Dresden.
The main feature is the injection of username and password on various login pages of portals of the TU. +
Other features are shortcuts, redirects from search engines, enhancement and more. +
It has multiple thousand users.

The project is open source and [hosted on Github](https://github.com/TUfast-TUD/TUfast_TUD).

## What did I do?
I am one of the first and one of the main contributors of the project.
At the time of writing this I rewrote the whole backend in TypeScript and prepared it to shift to the [Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/).
